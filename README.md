# Grocery Store

The grocery store is an online store simulator. By entering the program, we can choose a role: Client or admin. For the admin, we first need to enter the correct password. By entering it, we have a choice: add a new product to the store, update the number of existing product and show the whole list of goods from all departments. After each action we can leave the program or go back to the admin pannel.

After logging in for the client, we enter our name, after which we are shown an instruction, after which we need to enter the amount of cash we took with us. Than we select a department, and there is a choice to move to another department or add a product. After selecting the product and its quantity, it is added to the cart. After that, we can proceed to the payment, where we are shown the goods we have chosen and how much cash we have left. If we dont have enough cash, we will be informed about it. After payment, the quantity of goods is automatically updated.

After checkout, we can continue shopping or leave the store
